👨🏻‍💻 I'm Jesus, a curious, hardworking individual who loves solving complex problems. Initially, I pursued my professional career as a Civil Engineer, but I have since redirected and focused my career towards the world of technology and data.
📊 And why am I interested in data? Because I believe data is the best tool to connect with the world, and when used effectively, it can help solve significant problems in multiple sectors, such as finance, sales processes, and negotiations, enhancing their profitability. 
➕What can I bring to your team? I primarily work with the following technologies, always focusing on their practical application to real-world problems.
